  What is an access token and refresh token?
  </div>
  <div className="gap-5"> 
    <p className="text-xl">Access tokens and refresh tokens are vital components in authentication systems. An access token is a short-lived authorization token that permits a client application to access specific resources or actions after a user successfully logs in. It serves as a temporary proof of authentication, included in request headers for secure communication. In contrast, a refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new access token when the original one expires, ensuring a seamless user experience without repeated logins. Secure storage of these tokens on the client-side, using methods like in-memory storage, secure cookies, or web storage, is essential. Adhering to security best practices, including protection against threats like XSS and CSRF, is crucial for safeguarding access and refresh tokens.</p>

    <h2 className="font-bold text-xl text-red-500">How do they work and where should we
store them on the client-side?</h2>
<p className="text-xl">Access tokens and refresh tokens work in tandem for user authentication. After a user logs in, the authentication server provides an access token that the client uses to access resources. When the access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token without the user needing to re-authenticate.

Storing tokens securely on the client-side is crucial. Options include in-memory storage, secure HTTP cookies, or web storage like localStorage. Cookies are often preferred for their security features. However, the choice depends on the specific application and security requirements. Protecting against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF is vital to ensure token safety.</p>

    <p className="text-xl">A job-related website built with React.js relies on various components and functionalities to deliver a user-friendly experience. React components, dynamic by nature, form the sites interface, encompassing features like job listings, search filters, and user profiles. The code leverages state management for real-time data updates and employs API calls to fetch job listings from remote sources. Routing ensures seamless navigation, while CSS or CSS-in-JS solutions handle styling. Authentication, database integration, and responsive design are integral. Search and filtering options enhance job discovery, and user interactions like job applications and saved listings are managed. Error handling, input validation, and performance optimizations are key considerations, along with SEO and deployment for hosting. In essence, React.js empowers the creation of robust, interactive job-related websites.</p>
